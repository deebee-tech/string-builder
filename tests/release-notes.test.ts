/**
 * 2.0.2 and 2.0.3 both shipped as a bare header with no body -- 2.0.2 was the exports-map fix that
 * repaired every CJS consumer, and nobody could read that it happened. Nothing failed:
 * semantic-release computed the right version, tagged, and published; only the notes were empty,
 * which no gate looked at.
 *
 * The cause was version skew. `preset: 'conventionalcommits'` resolves the top-level
 * conventional-changelog-conventionalcommits, which moved to a new
 * `{commits, parser, writer, whatBump}` export shape in v10, while this plugin's bundled
 * conventional-changelog-writer@8 still expects the old one. It does not throw on the mismatch --
 * it emits the header and silently drops every commit.
 *
 * So this runs the REAL plugin with the REAL config from release.config.mjs. Re-adding a skewed
 * preset fails here rather than eight releases later.
